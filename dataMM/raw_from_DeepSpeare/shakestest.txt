<eos> and therefore to your fair no painting set <eos> i found ,  or thought i found ,  you did exceed <eos> that barren tender of a poet 's debt <eos> and therefore have i slept in your report <eos> that you yourself ,  being extant ,  well might show <eos> how far a modern quill doth come too short <eos> speaking of worth ,  what worth in you doth grow <eos> this silence for my sin you did impute <eos> which shall be most my glory being dumb <eos> for i impair not beauty being mute <eos> when others would give life ,  and bring a tomb <eos> there lives more life in one of your fair eyes <eos> than both your poets can in praise devise <eos> 
<eos> than this rich praise :  that you alone are you <eos> in whose confine immured is the store <eos> which should example where your equal grew <eos> lean penury within that pen doth dwell <eos> that to his subject lends not some small glory <eos> but he that writes of you ,  if he can tell <eos> that you are you ,  so dignifies his story <eos> let him but copy what in you is writ <eos> not making worse what nature made so clear <eos> and such a counterpart shall fame his wit <eos> making his style admired every where <eos> you to your beauteous blessings add a curse <eos> being fond on praise ,  which makes your praises worse <eos> 
<eos> while comments of your praise richly compil 'd <eos> reserve their character with golden quill <eos> and precious phrase by all the muses fil 'd <eos> i think good thoughts ,  whilst others write good words <eos> and like unlettered clerk still cry  ' amen <eos> to every hymn that able spirit affords <eos> in polish 'd form of well-refined pen <eos> hearing you praised ,  i say  '  'tis so ,   'tis true <eos> and to the most of praise add something more <eos> but that is in my thought ,  whose love to you <eos> though words come hindmost ,  holds his rank before <eos> then others ,  for the breath of words respect <eos> me for my dumb thoughts ,  speaking in effect <eos> 
<eos> and i will comment upon that offence <eos> speak of my lameness ,  and i straight will halt <eos> against thy reasons making no defence <eos> thou canst not love disgrace me half so ill <eos> to set a form upon desired change <eos> as i 'll myself disgrace ;  knowing thy will <eos> i will acquaintance strangle ,  and look strange <eos> be absent from thy walks ;  and in my tongue <eos> thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell <eos> lest i ,  too much profane ,  should do it wrong <eos> and haply of our old acquaintance tell <eos> for thee ,  against my self i 'll vow debate <eos> for i must ne 'er love him whom thou dost hate <eos> 
<eos> now ,  while the world is bent my deeds to cross <eos> join with the spite of fortune ,  make me bow <eos> and do not drop in for an after-loss <eos> ah !  do not ,  when my heart hath  'scap 'd this sorrow <eos> come in the rearward of a conquer 'd woe <eos> give not a windy night a rainy morrow <eos> to linger out a purpos 'd overthrow <eos> if thou wilt leave me ,  do not leave me last <eos> when other petty griefs have done their spite <eos> but in the onset come :  so shall i taste <eos> at first the very worst of fortune 's might <eos> and other strains of woe ,  which now seem woe <eos> compar 'd with loss of thee ,  will not seem so <eos> 
<eos> for they in thee a thousand errors note <eos> but  'tis my heart that loves what they despise <eos> who ,  in despite of view ,  is pleased to dote <eos> nor are mine ears with thy tongue 's tune delighted <eos> nor tender feeling ,  to base touches prone <eos> nor taste ,  nor smell ,  desire to be invited <eos> to any sensual feast with thee alone <eos> but my five wits nor my five senses can <eos> dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee <eos> who leaves unsway 'd the likeness of a man <eos> thy proud heart 's slave and vassal wretch to be <eos> only my plague thus far i count my gain <eos> that she that makes me sin awards me pain <eos> 
<eos> hate of my sin ,  grounded on sinful loving <eos> o !  but with mine compare thou thine own state <eos> and thou shalt find it merits not reproving <eos> or ,  if it do ,  not from those lips of thine <eos> that have profan 'd their scarlet ornaments <eos> and seal 'd false bonds of love as oft as mine <eos> robb 'd others ' beds ' revenues of their rents <eos> be it lawful i love thee ,  as thou lov 'st those <eos> whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee <eos> root pity in thy heart ,  that ,  when it grows <eos> thy pity may deserve to pitied be <eos> if thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide <eos> by self-example mayst thou be denied <eos> 
<eos> upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds <eos> with thy sweet fingers when thou gently sway 'st <eos> the wiry concord that mine ear confounds <eos> do i envy those jacks that nimble leap <eos> to kiss the tender inward of thy hand <eos> whilst my poor lips which should that harvest reap <eos> at the wood 's boldness by thee blushing stand <eos> to be so tickled ,  they would change their state <eos> and situation with those dancing chips <eos> o 'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait <eos> making dead wood more bless 'd than living lips <eos> since saucy jacks so happy are in this <eos> give them thy fingers ,  me thy lips to kiss <eos> 
<eos> is lust in action :  and till action ,  lust <eos> is perjur 'd ,  murderous ,  bloody ,  full of blame <eos> savage ,  extreme ,  rude ,  cruel ,  not to trust <eos> enjoy 'd no sooner but despised straight <eos> past reason hunted ;  and no sooner had <eos> past reason hated ,  as a swallow 'd bait <eos> on purpose laid to make the taker mad <eos> mad in pursuit and in possession so <eos> had ,  having ,  and in quest ,  to have extreme <eos> a bliss in proof ,  and proved ,  a very woe <eos> before ,  a joy propos 'd ;  behind a dream <eos> all this the world well knows ;  yet none knows well <eos> to shun the heaven that leads men to this hell <eos> 
<eos> coral is far more red ,  than her lips red <eos> if snow be white ,  why then her breasts are dun <eos> if hairs be wires ,  black wires grow on her head <eos> i have seen roses damask 'd ,  red and white <eos> but no such roses see i in her cheeks <eos> and in some perfumes is there more delight <eos> than in the breath that from my mistress reeks <eos> i love to hear her speak ,  yet well i know <eos> that music hath a far more pleasing sound <eos> i grant i never saw a goddess go <eos> my mistress ,  when she walks ,  treads on the ground <eos> and yet by heaven ,  i think my love as rare <eos> as any she belied with false compare <eos> 
<eos> one of her feather 'd creatures broke away <eos> sets down her babe ,  and makes all swift dispatch <eos> in pursuit of the thing she would have stay <eos> whilst her neglected child holds her in chase <eos> cries to catch her whose busy care is bent <eos> to follow that which flies before her face <eos> not prizing her poor infant 's discontent <eos> so runn 'st thou after that which flies from thee <eos> whilst i thy babe chase thee afar behind <eos> but if thou catch thy hope ,  turn back to me <eos> and play the mother 's part ,  kiss me ,  be kind <eos> so will i pray that thou mayst have thy  ' will <eos> if thou turn back and my loud crying still <eos> 
<eos> which like two spirits do suggest me still <eos> the better angel is a man right fair <eos> the worser spirit a woman colour 'd ill <eos> to win me soon to hell ,  my female evil <eos> tempteth my better angel from my side <eos> and would corrupt my saint to be a devil <eos> wooing his purity with her foul pride <eos> and whether that my angel be turn 'd fiend <eos> suspect i may ,  yet not directly tell <eos> but being both from me ,  both to each friend <eos> i guess one angel in another 's hell <eos> yet this shall i ne 'er know ,  but live in doubt <eos> till my bad angel fire my good one out <eos> 
<eos> breathed forth the sound that said  ' i hate <eos> to me that languish 'd for her sake <eos> but when she saw my woeful state <eos> straight in her heart did mercy come <eos> chiding that tongue that ever sweet <eos> was us 'd in giving gentle doom <eos> and taught it thus anew to greet <eos>  ' i hate ' she alter 'd with an end <eos> that followed it as gentle day <eos> doth follow night ,  who like a fiend <eos> from heaven to hell is flown away <eos>  ' i hate ' ,  from hate away she threw <eos> and sav 'd my life ,  saying  ' not you <eos> 
<eos> so long as youth and thou are of one date <eos> but when in thee time 's furrows i behold <eos> then look i death my days should expiate <eos> for all that beauty that doth cover thee <eos> is but the seemly raiment of my heart <eos> which in thy breast doth live ,  as thine in me <eos> how can i then be elder than thou art <eos> o !  therefore love ,  be of thyself so wary <eos> as i ,  not for myself ,  but for thee will <eos> bearing thy heart ,  which i will keep so chary <eos> as tender nurse her babe from faring ill <eos> presume not on thy heart when mine is slain <eos> thou gav 'st me thine not to give back again <eos> 
<eos> who with his fear is put beside his part <eos> or some fierce thing replete with too much rage <eos> whose strength 's abundance weakens his own heart <eos> so i ,  for fear of trust ,  forget to say <eos> the perfect ceremony of love 's rite <eos> and in mine own love 's strength seem to decay <eos> o 'ercharg 'd with burthen of mine own love 's might <eos> o !  let my looks be then the eloquence <eos> and dumb presagers of my speaking breast <eos> who plead for love ,  and look for recompense <eos> more than that tongue that more hath more express 'd <eos> o !  learn to read what silent love hath writ <eos> to hear with eyes belongs to love 's fine wit <eos> 
<eos> thy beauty 's form in table of my heart <eos> my body is the frame wherein  'tis held <eos> and perspective it is best painter 's art <eos> for through the painter must you see his skill <eos> to find where your true image pictur 'd lies <eos> which in my bosom 's shop is hanging still <eos> that hath his windows glazed with thine eyes <eos> now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done <eos> mine eyes have drawn thy shape ,  and thine for me <eos> are windows to my breast ,  where-through the sun <eos> delights to peep ,  to gaze therein on thee <eos> yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art <eos> they draw but what they see ,  know not the heart <eos> 
<eos> of public honour and proud titles boast <eos> whilst i ,  whom fortune of such triumph bars <eos> unlook 'd for joy in that i honour most <eos> great princes ' favourites their fair leaves spread <eos> but as the marigold at the sun 's eye <eos> and in themselves their pride lies buried <eos> for at a frown they in their glory die <eos> the painful warrior famoused for fight <eos> after a thousand victories once foil 'd <eos> is from the book of honour razed quite <eos> and all the rest forgot for which he toil 'd <eos> then happy i ,  that love and am belov 'd <eos> where i may not remove nor be remov 'd <eos> 
<eos> from fairest creatures we desire increase <eos> that thereby beauty 's rose might never die <eos> but as the riper should by time decease <eos> his tender heir might bear his memory <eos> but thou ,  contracted to thine own bright eyes <eos> feed 'st thy light 's flame with self-substantial fuel <eos> making a famine where abundance lies <eos> thyself thy foe ,  to thy sweet self too cruel <eos> thou that art now the world 's fresh ornament <eos> and only herald to the gaudy spring <eos> within thine own bud buriest thy content <eos> and tender churl mak 'st waste in niggarding <eos> pity the world ,  or else this glutton be <eos> to eat the world 's due ,  by the grave and thee <eos> 
<eos> and dig deep trenches in thy beauty 's field <eos> thy youth 's proud livery so gazed on now <eos> will be a tatter 'd weed of small worth held <eos> then being asked ,  where all thy beauty lies <eos> where all the treasure of thy lusty days <eos> to say ,  within thine own deep sunken eyes <eos> were an all-eating shame ,  and thriftless praise <eos> how much more praise deserv 'd thy beauty 's use <eos> if thou couldst answer  ' this fair child of mine <eos> shall sum my count ,  and make my old excuse <eos> proving his beauty by succession thine <eos> this were to be new made when thou art old <eos> and see thy blood warm when thou feel 'st it cold <eos> 
<eos> now is the time that face should form another <eos> whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest <eos> thou dost beguile the world ,  unbless some mother <eos> for where is she so fair whose unear 'd womb <eos> disdains the tillage of thy husbandry <eos> or who is he so fond will be the tomb <eos> of his self-love to stop posterity <eos> thou art thy mother 's glass and she in thee <eos> calls back the lovely april of her prime <eos> so thou through windows of thine age shalt see <eos> despite of wrinkles this thy golden time <eos> but if thou live ,  remember 'd not to be <eos> die single and thine image dies with thee <eos> 
<eos> upon thyself thy beauty 's legacy <eos> nature 's bequest gives nothing ,  but doth lend <eos> and being frank she lends to those are free <eos> then ,  beauteous niggard ,  why dost thou abuse <eos> the bounteous largess given thee to give <eos> profitless usurer ,  why dost thou use <eos> so great a sum of sums ,  yet canst not live <eos> for having traffic with thyself alone <eos> thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive <eos> then how when nature calls thee to be gone <eos> what acceptable audit canst thou leave <eos> thy unused beauty must be tombed with thee <eos> which ,  used ,  lives th ' executor to be <eos> 
<eos> if it were fill 'd with your most high deserts <eos> though yet heaven knows it is but as a tomb <eos> which hides your life ,  and shows not half your parts <eos> if i could write the beauty of your eyes <eos> and in fresh numbers number all your graces <eos> the age to come would say  ' this poet lies <eos> such heavenly touches ne 'er touch 'd earthly faces <eos> so should my papers ,  yellow 'd with their age <eos> be scorn 'd ,  like old men of less truth than tongue <eos> and your true rights be term 'd a poet 's rage <eos> and stretched metre of an antique song <eos> but were some child of yours alive that time <eos> you should live twice , —in it ,  and in my rhyme <eos> 
<eos> thou art more lovely and more temperate <eos> rough winds do shake the darling buds of may <eos> and summer 's lease hath all too short a date <eos> sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines <eos> and often is his gold complexion dimm 'd <eos> and every fair from fair sometime declines <eos> by chance ,  or nature 's changing course untrimm 'd <eos> but thy eternal summer shall not fade <eos> nor lose possession of that fair thou ow 'st <eos> nor shall death brag thou wander 'st in his shade <eos> when in eternal lines to time thou grow 'st <eos> so long as men can breathe ,  or eyes can see <eos> so long lives this ,  and this gives life to thee <eos> 
<eos> how to divide the conquest of thy sight <eos> mine eye my heart thy picture 's sight would bar <eos> my heart mine eye the freedom of that right <eos> my heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie <eos> a closet never pierced with crystal eyes <eos> but the defendant doth that plea deny <eos> and says in him thy fair appearance lies <eos> to side this title is impannelled <eos> a quest of thoughts ,  all tenants to the heart <eos> and by their verdict is determined <eos> the clear eye 's moiety ,  and the dear heart 's part <eos> as thus ;  mine eye 's due is thy outward part <eos> and my heart 's right ,  thy inward love of heart <eos> 
<eos> and each doth good turns now unto the other <eos> when that mine eye is famish 'd for a look <eos> or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother <eos> with my love 's picture then my eye doth feast <eos> and to the painted banquet bids my heart <eos> another time mine eye is my heart 's guest <eos> and in his thoughts of love doth share a part <eos> so ,  either by thy picture or my love <eos> thyself away ,  art present still with me <eos> for thou not farther than my thoughts canst move <eos> and i am still with them ,  and they with thee <eos> or ,  if they sleep ,  thy picture in my sight <eos> awakes my heart ,  to heart 's and eye 's delight <eos> 
<eos> and all my soul ,  and all my every part <eos> and for this sin there is no remedy <eos> it is so grounded inward in my heart <eos> methinks no face so gracious is as mine <eos> no shape so true ,  no truth of such account <eos> and for myself mine own worth do define <eos> as i all other in all worths surmount <eos> but when my glass shows me myself indeed <eos> beated and chopp 'd with tanned antiquity <eos> mine own self-love quite contrary i read <eos> self so self-loving were iniquity <eos>  'tis thee ,  myself ,  that for myself i praise <eos> painting my age with beauty of thy days <eos> 
<eos> with time 's injurious hand crush 'd and o 'erworn <eos> when hours have drain 'd his blood and fill 'd his brow <eos> with lines and wrinkles ;  when his youthful morn <eos> hath travell 'd on to age 's steepy night <eos> and all those beauties whereof now he 's king <eos> are vanishing ,  or vanished out of sight <eos> stealing away the treasure of his spring <eos> for such a time do i now fortify <eos> against confounding age 's cruel knife <eos> that he shall never cut from memory <eos> my sweet love 's beauty ,  though my lover 's life <eos> his beauty shall in these black lines be seen <eos> and they shall live ,  and he in them still green <eos> 
<eos> the rich-proud cost of outworn buried age <eos> when sometime lofty towers i see down-raz 'd <eos> and brass eternal slave to mortal rage <eos> when i have seen the hungry ocean gain <eos> advantage on the kingdom of the shore <eos> and the firm soil win of the watery main <eos> increasing store with loss ,  and loss with store <eos> when i have seen such interchange of state <eos> or state itself confounded ,  to decay <eos> ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate <eos> that time will come and take my love away <eos> this thought is as a death which cannot choose <eos> but weep to have ,  that which it fears to lose <eos> 
<eos> laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand <eos> whilst many nymphs that vow 'd chaste life to keep <eos> came tripping by ;  but in her maiden hand <eos> the fairest votary took up that fire <eos> which many legions of true hearts had warm 'd <eos> and so the general of hot desire <eos> was ,  sleeping ,  by a virgin hand disarm 'd <eos> this brand she quenched in a cool well by <eos> which from love 's fire took heat perpetual <eos> growing a bath and healthful remedy <eos> for men diseas 'd ;  but i ,  my mistress ' thrall <eos> came there for cure and this by that i prove <eos> love 's fire heats water ,  water cools not love <eos> 
<eos> sweets with sweets war not ,  joy delights in joy <eos> why lov 'st thou that which thou receiv 'st not gladly <eos> or else receiv 'st with pleasure thine annoy <eos> if the true concord of well-tuned sounds <eos> by unions married ,  do offend thine ear <eos> they do but sweetly chide thee ,  who confounds <eos> in singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear <eos> mark how one string ,  sweet husband to another <eos> strikes each in each by mutual ordering <eos> resembling sire and child and happy mother <eos> who ,  all in one ,  one pleasing note do sing <eos> whose speechless song being many ,  seeming one <eos> sings this to thee :   ' thou single wilt prove none <eos> 
<eos> thy pyramids built up with newer might <eos> to me are nothing novel ,  nothing strange <eos> they are but dressings of a former sight <eos> our dates are brief ,  and therefore we admire <eos> what thou dost foist upon us that is old <eos> and rather make them born to our desire <eos> than think that we before have heard them told <eos> thy registers and thee i both defy <eos> not wondering at the present nor the past <eos> for thy records and what we see doth lie <eos> made more or less by thy continual haste <eos> this i do vow and this shall ever be <eos> i will be true despite thy scythe and thee <eos>
